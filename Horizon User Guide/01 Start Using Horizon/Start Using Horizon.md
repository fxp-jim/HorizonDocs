---
#### Items
An item is a fundamental unit that can be included in various types of orders. It encompasses everything that can be added to an order, such as products, configurators, equipment, and discounts. Each type of item has distinct attributes and leads to the creation of different demand records when ordered. All types of items are categorized as "Items" and are stored in the main item database table.

---
#### Products
Products are consumable physical items that can be created or purchased, each with prices (e.g., vendor prices) for picking and selling.

---

#### Services
Services refer to intangible items the company offers its customers and clients. This includes providing food and beverage solutions tailored to the needs of events or gatherings. It encompasses menu planning, food preparation, delivery, setup, and potentially serving guests during the occasion.

---

#### Configurators  
Configurators offer customers a set of predetermined choices for a specific sales order. These choices are defined in the configurator and allow users to select a specific number of items, totaling a specific quantity from a particular category. Each choice results in a specific sales order item being entered, and the configurator also determines the Bill of Materials (BOM) needed to produce the chosen product.

---

#### Equipment
Equipment refers to essential items used in various aspects of product creation and order fulfillment. This can range from basic kitchen utensils like plates and knives to larger items necessary for catering social events, such as tables, chairs, and cloths. Equipment is also included in the Bill of Materials, which outlines all necessary items for creating products.

### 4 **Sales Orders**
Select this menu when recording the sale of products or services to a customer. Sales Order records specify the transaction time, specific details of the ordered goods or services, and a comprehensive list of items sold, including any configurations.

### 5 **Invoices**  
Invoices are accounting documents issued to customers and clients to record sales transactions and request payment. They specify the agreed-upon prices, quantities, and terms of the sale as detailed in the sales order and include any discounts and taxes applied.

### 6 **Bill of Materials (BOM)**  
A Bill of Materials is akin to a detailed recipe for creating a product. It outlines the necessary parts or materials, their quantities, and how they are assembled. BOMs can accommodate different versions or configurations of the product, although typically only one is used at any given time for production.

### 7 **Lead**  
A lead is a recorded instance of a potential customer expressing interest in a product, service, or opportunity. It includes the individual's name, details of their inquiry (e.g., inquiring for a wedding party), and the source of the lead (e.g., phone call). Additional information such as contact details and specifics about the opportunity they are interested in (e.g., planning a wedding) are also typically included. Leads are pivotal in sales and marketing, representing prospects that may convert into customers with further engagement.

---
#### Demand
Demand represents the quantity of an item required by a specific date or time. It is categorized by types such as purchase, build, or pick, which dictate how the demand should be fulfilled. Sales orders are a primary source of generating demand in this context.
