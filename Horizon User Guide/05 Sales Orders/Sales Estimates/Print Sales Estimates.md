Locate the existing order for a specific party on the left side of the screen using [Browse Mode](https://github.com/Fx-Professional-Services/HorizonDocs/blob/main/Horizon%20User%20Guide/VIII.%20Searching%20on%20Horizon/Browse%20Mode.md) or [Find Mode](https://github.com/Fx-Professional-Services/HorizonDocs/blob/main/Horizon%20User%20Guide/VIII.%20Searching%20on%20Horizon/Find%20Mode.md).
