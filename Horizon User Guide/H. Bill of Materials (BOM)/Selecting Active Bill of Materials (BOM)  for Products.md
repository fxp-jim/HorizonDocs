### Select Active BOMs for Products
_____________
Ensuring the right Bill of Materials (BOM) is active is crucial for generating demand. Follow these simple steps:

1. **Navigate to Products:** Go to the main menu and select **Products**.
    
2. **Choose a Product:** Find the product you want to work with on the left side of the screen. You can use either [Browse Mode](https://github.com/Fx-Professional-Services/HorizonDocs/blob/main/Horizon%20User%20Guide/VIII.%20Searching%20on%20Horizon/Browse%20Mode.md) or [Find Mode](https://github.com/Fx-Professional-Services/HorizonDocs/blob/main/Horizon%20User%20Guide/VIII.%20Searching%20on%20Horizon/Find%20Mode.md).
    
3. **Set Active BOM:** Click on the **Active BOM** box.
    
4. **Select an Item:** In the pop-up form, choose an item by either clicking the **Add** button (✚) next to it or typing its name in the search box. Once selected, click **Done**. This will take you back to the original layout, and the active BOM will be set.

That's it! You can now proceed to set active BOMs for other products if needed. If you have any further questions, feel free to contact our support team.
