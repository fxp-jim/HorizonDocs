Adding taxable line items to a sales order is an important step to ensure accurate sales transactions and tax calculations for each item. Follow these simple steps:

1. Begin by navigating to the **main menu** and selecting **Sales Orders**.

2. Select the party or customer in left pane. 

3. Under **Sales Order Items**, locate the item you want to make taxable and click on the **tax** box until a checkmark (✔️) appears. The tax will be calculated real-time, and the additional tax value will be automatically added in the **total cost** calculation.

4. Finally, click on **Save Changes** to confirm and apply the changes made to the sales order.
